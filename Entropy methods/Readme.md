**Entropy methods**

Visualize off different entropy outputs. Determining the regularity of series of a signal. We tried various configurations below and have shown the best output. For illustration purposes only, we will use the patient ID PD809 off medication to compare the output results. This allows for a reduction of our research.

* Sampling rate (hz): 100
* Processing Tau (time lag): 2
* Embedding dimension: 3
* Fuzzy power: 2


SampleEntropy has show the largest variation.
