# Medication_optPD

### Overview

This repository contains the code and data related to the master's thesis project titled "New algorithm for medication optimization using regression method for Parkinson’s disease with EEG and sample entropy" by Filipe António Da Silva at the University of Luxembourg.

The project focuses on the impact of electroencephalography (EEG) and drug monitoring in the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's Disease (PD). The goal is to demonstrate the potential use of EEG for evaluating medications in PD and highlight the limitations of currently available public datasets.

### Abstract

Parkinson’s disease (PD) detection remains an ongoing challenge as there is no specific test for its diagnosis. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have shown great potential in medical applications. This project explores the use of EEG and sample entropy (SampEn) in detecting and optimizing medication for PD. The study aims to address the high costs associated with current diagnostic tests like MRI, CT, and DAT-scan, and present EEG as a cost-effective alternative.
