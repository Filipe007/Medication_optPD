# Medication_optPD

### Overview

This repository contains the code and data related to the master's thesis.

The project focuses on the impact of electroencephalography (EEG) and drug monitoring in the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's Disease (PD). The goal is to demonstrate the potential use of EEG for evaluating medications in PD and highlight the limitations of currently available public datasets.

### Original code
The original code is linked to the work "An open-source EEGLAB plugin for computing entropy-based measures on MEG signals" and it can be download:

### Original data set
By the Cognitive Rhythms and Computation Lab at University of New Mexico
https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003490/versions/1.1.0
For the second data set each PD patient was divided in 4 sub set of 52 seconds.

### Abstract

Parkinson’s disease (PD) detection remains an ongoing challenge as there is no specific test for its diagnosis. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have shown great potential in medical applications. This project explores the use of EEG and sample entropy (SampEn) in detecting and optimizing medication for PD. The study aims to address the high costs associated with current diagnostic tests like MRI, CT, and DAT-scan, and present EEG as a cost-effective alternative.
