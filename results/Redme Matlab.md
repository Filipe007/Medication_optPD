# Matlab app
I used the matlab linear regression app to process several regression models. The output are saved in csv files. Each 
folder contain the results from the regression model and how to run it.
I recommend to use a larger data set with quantitative and qualitative information. 
Matlab app is very useful to investigate which model perform the best and fine tune it.
## Code for prof of use of concept
Due to lack of quantitative and qualitative data our code regression model should be only used
of concept. Code is in src folder.
